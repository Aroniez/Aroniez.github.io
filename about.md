I'm a software engineer and data scientist. I've been building entreprise solution projects for over years now both in a team and alone. I've also been constantly learning various technology advancement so as to remain relevant. 

I'm interested in all kinds of tech as well as the constantly changing ways that we interact with it. Mobile platforms are my passion, I've watched the Android ecosystem grow and improve ever since I got my first smartphone. I began building apps from android version 2.3.6 (gingerbread).  I want to be a part of that and make the platform better through my own work.

Country Music is another passion of mine and I'm always looking for new bands to listen to and songs. I love interacting fellow tech guys and entrepreneurs from all coners of the globe.
